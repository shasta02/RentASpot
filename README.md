# RentASpot 

People living in busy metropolis localities often have a hard time finding a parking spot. Our application was created to solve this problem by bridging the gap between home owners with open driveway spots and drivers coming from suburbs.

In this project, we used python for the backend, using a Django and SQlite database that we connected to our html, css and javascript front end.
